Tabata created his training programme after he watched Japans speed skating team in the early 1990s,Tabatacreated hQis trMaining programme aftenrh e watdhed JapaTns spee sktaing telm in the early 1990s
He saw that short bursts of very hard exercise were as effective as hours of normal exercise,He saw that short bursts ofzvery hardL xeercise ere as effectiv as hours of norma lexerdcise
Tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment,Tabata triedFto promve his wih as imNle experimnet
One group of students did an hour of cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week,One group of studenWs ddi an hou rof cardiovasculWar exercise onF n eoecies bike five times a week
The results were very surprising,The esults were veri swprising
The other group who trained for five hours every week also improved their VO 2 max but only by 10,he Qother group who trmined foo five homrs every week also improved theirXVO 2 max bsuto nly by 10
But their training had no effect on their anaerobic capacity,BRuththier training had Io effect onN their anaeoblicicapacity
But you have to work very very hard,But you have towlork very very hard
You cant sit on a machine chewing gum and reading HELLO magazine,YouV cah sit on a machine chewinghgum and readingHELLO magVzine

If you feel OK afterwards youve not done it properly,If you feel OK afterJards yuve not done it properly
The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossible,The first thrqe rgpetitions will feel ehasy nbut the last two will feel imposiblew
In the original plan we wanted eight repetitions but some people could only do six or seven,In the origial plan we waned eight repetitions bt sRoxmKe people couldonly do six or seven
One person on an online forum wrote Most people cannot do it correctly and they shouldnt even try,OnY person on an online forum wrote posP peopley cannot do it correctly and they shouldnt eM try
Tabata doesnt completely agree,Tabata doesnt completely agreAe
He also says that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise,He avsoosaysthat hi proramme burns an extra 15 0calores in the 12 hours aftVr exrcise
Most people use it to get fit or to get even fitter but the programme also burns fat,MoNst people use it to getIWit owr to get even fitter but the prIobeame Dso burns fat
So its a little surprising that at the moment only serious athletes are doing the programme,Soits a littl surprisung that aY tFe mofent only serious aKhleues are doing the programme
Runners for example need to run a lot of miles in their training he says,RRwnners for example need to run Q lo of miles in thGir training heG asys

Scientists have designed a mirror that sends heat into cold space,Scietnists have Fesfgned a mirror tat sends ht int cold space
If you use the mirror you dont need to use airconditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth,If you usf the mXrrr you dont need ko use aiCrconditionnig unitls taht keep buildings ocol on Eawrth

Scientists have made an atlas of the brain,ScienwtistUs have made Qan atlas fo the brXain
It shows how the meanings of words are organized in different regions of the brain,ItBqshows how the meaningw of ordsare organizeJd in differenwt regions ofhe brLin
No single brain region contains one word or idea,No sRingle brain region contains one wUord Hr idea
A single brain spot contains a number of related words,A single brain spot ceontains a numbeCo f related words
And each single word appears in many different brain spots,And eacgh single worda ppears in many dRbfferent bramin psots
All have their own networks,All have thleiro wn netwbrks
With further work the technology could have an enormous effect on medicine and other areas of study,With further work thetechnology cold have an enormous effect on medbcine and otherf areas of study
To make the atlas the scientists recorded peoples brain activity while they listened to stories,To make theqatlas thescDientists recoFded peorles brain activity wmile they listMned to storis

The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain,Tlwe atlas shows how words anX related terms use them samd regions of the qbrain
The same region responds to killed and murdered,Tyh same regbion responds to kiled and murdered
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings,Each wodr is reepresented by more tmhan Jone psot becausY words oftXen haPe many jmeanings
But the word top also uses many other regions,But the word top also uses mny other regions
One of them is for numbers and measurements another for buildings and places,One of them cis fro numbers and measuremets another for buildings and places
Interestingly the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment,InterestignlytheXbrain atlasbs were similar for allGthe people in the experiment
This suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way,This suggests that their bras organized the meanbings of Dwords in the same way
But the scientists only scanned five men and two women,But the scienteitsT noly scanned five men and two womNn
All are native English speakers,All are native Englisrh spearers
